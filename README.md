CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?



One of the biggest differences between the project structure of Angular and Express, is that Express uses Node.js to produce HTML pages for our client side. Once the client makes a request for a for a page, the request is converted and rendered for viewing. We used the NoSQL MongoDB in order to work seamlessly with the Express part of our application.


Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.



JSON files represent different object that we create with JavaScript, they hold information and can be used to update an object. Refactoring the code into reusable parts improved the readability and speed of the user interface. 



Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.



In order to make sure the SPA is working with the API to GET and PUT data into the database, you should verify user/administrator authorization and authentication, verify API and URL keys are functional, and verify login details. Some errors that you may run into to within the testing process are login errors, network errors, request errors, and fatal errors


Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field



This course introduced what I believe is the traditional approach to fullstack development. It gave me the chance to understand and work with the MongoDB more deeply. Upon completion, I will use the skills learned here to make robust and secure web applications.
